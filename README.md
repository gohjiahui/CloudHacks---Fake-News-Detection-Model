# CloudHacks -Fake-News-Detection-Model üîç

The idea of this project was inspired by Scamschield. ScamShield has features to block scam messages and spam calls. I thought of having another real-life problem that needs AI detection like ScamShield, such as reading the news. When we read news online, we do not which is the truth, or which is fake. Therefore, I have come up with the idea of having a Fake News Detection tool.
